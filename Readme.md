# Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator

## Project Overview
This project simulates disk scheduling algorithms and visualizes disk head movements. It is developed as part of our BTech CSE 2nd year, 4th semester assignment.

## Module Breakdown
- **User Input Module:**  
  Collects disk requests and the initial head position from the user, with proper input validation.
- **Algorithm Engine:**  
  Implements disk scheduling algorithms (starting with FCFS) and calculates performance metrics such as total head movement and average seek time.
- **Visualization Module:**  
  Uses Matplotlib to display the disk head movement and performance metrics graphically.

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Matplotlib
- **Other Tools:** GitHub for version control, VSCode for development
